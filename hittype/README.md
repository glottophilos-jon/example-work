___________________________

The HitType package allows for typing in Hittite Cuneiform in LaTeX documents, using relatively simple commands based on the Latin transcriptions of the various signs. It also includes some formatting commands designed to allow for easy formatting of heterographic compounds, as well as shorthands for symbols commonly used in transcriptions.

The hittype-doc.tex file is the LaTeX version of the documentation which can be run as a testing ground for new users.
