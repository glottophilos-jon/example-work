___________________________

The LuwianType package allows for typing in Hieroglyphic Luwian in LaTeX documents, using relatively simple commands based on the Latin transcriptions of the various signs. It also includes some formatting commands designed to allow boustrophedon and columns, as well as shorthands for symbols commonly used in transcriptions.

The luwiantype-doc.tex file is the LaTeX version of the documentation which can be run as a testing ground for new users.
